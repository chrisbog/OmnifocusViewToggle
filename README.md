# OmnifocusViewToggle
Quick Applescript to toggle the View status of OmniFocus

## Overview
Throughout the day in Omnifocus, I have a need to quickly change the view filter of the current task list.   By doing it through the menus it requires way too many mouse clicks to just change between "all" and "available"

This AppleScript is very simple in that it will determine the current state of the view filter and toggle between All and Remaining.

## Requirements
1. Omnifocus Pro Edition

## Installation Instructions
1. You can copy this script into the Applescript Editor.  
2. Save the script to a .scpt file.
3. Copy the compiled script to the Omnifocus Scripting Directory (You can find this by starting Omnifocus and doing "Help->Open Scripts Folder"
4. You can install the script on the toolbar, but editing the toolbar and dragging the function to the current toolbar.
